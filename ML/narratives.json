Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. \nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, growth margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. \nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apples Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of FY16, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. \nIn addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. \nRevenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. \nWe saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. \nDespite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. \nWe sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. \nAs we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a ",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR and Treasury    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri.

Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018.\nThis year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever.\nRevenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.\nIt was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.\nThe A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photo, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual-camera system that sho",

Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, and welcome to AMD's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. By now, you should've had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's website, amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website. \nI would like to highlight some important dates for you. In celebration of AMD's 50th anniversary on May 1, 2019, Dr. Lisa Su and members of AMD's executive leadership team will host a panel discussion reflecting on 50 years of innovation by AMD. This will be held at the NASDAQ MarketSite in New York City. Dr. Lisa Su, President and Chief Executive Officer, will also be delivering a keynote address at COMPUTEX in Taiwan on Monday, May 27; Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, HR and Investor Relations will present at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, June 4; and our 2019 second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 14, 2019. \nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced on this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release, which is posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. \nNow with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa.",

It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAnd just briefly before we move to questions, I would like to address our Form 10-K that we will be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K, and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures.\nWe will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the Company or our segments.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.\nAs you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n------------------------------------------------------------------",

In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.\nAs you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------",

Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEllen West,  Alphabet, Inc. - Head of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at ABC. XYZ/investor.\nThis call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet, Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks. Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience.\nWe also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.

Advertising revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business.

Next, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.

We had a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users, and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers. \nFor the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion were up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search, with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search. \nFor today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and we'll conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Let me start with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. \nOur total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year",

Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. They're all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone. \nWhen we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers and all the customers of our growing cloud business and the communities we call home. From the beginning, Google's mission has been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Today, I'll share how we are approaching this work.  \nBuilding a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our popular full coverage feature to Search to better organize news results. We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So if, say, you're searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match.\nThanks to advancements in AI, we are making significant improvements to the Google Assistant. The next-generation Assistant can process requests up to 10x faster, making it easier to multitask, compose e-mails and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the Web, ",

We celebrated Google's 21st birthday this quarter. While our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful hasn't changed, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. \nSince the beginning, we have always invested in tackling deep computer science problems that can have a significant impact on society. The chance to be part of these fundamental engineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google. In just the last week, we have announced 2 significant advances: first, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search. It's the biggest leap forward for search in the past 5 years. It's all possible because of a new type of neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in language and provides more relevant resource. \nSecond, we recently announced a major quantum computing milestone. I was extraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To demonstrate supremacy, Google's 53-qubit quantum machine, Sycamore, successfully perfo",

When I last spoke with you in early February, no one could have imagined how much the world would change and how suddenly. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19, especially those who have lost loved ones or their livelihoods. It's a challenging moment for the world. Through it all, we are incredibly grateful for all of the essential workers on the front lines of this crisis: from health care workers and first responders; to the grocery store clerks and delivery workers; to teachers, grappling with new technology to help children learn remotely; to all the scientists and researchers working hard to develop vaccines and treatments; and many others who are leading through these difficult times. Thank you. These people fill us with hope and show us the power of human resilience. We'll need that energy and resolve in the months and years ahead. \nToday, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path to recovery, but there are some things that we can understand better with the patterns we are seeing. For example, it's clear from data that people are being more cautious and are seeking authoritative advice and guidance to protect their families' health and safety.

It's a privilege to join the call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google after 4 years as CEO of Google. I'd like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless mission, endearing values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world.\nThere's a lot I want to cover today, and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth. As you've seen in our press release, we've added new revenue disclosures to give greater insight into our business. Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth. I'm also really pleased with 2 of our newer growth areas. YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019, growing at 36% compared with 2018, and it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers, ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other nonadvertising revenues. Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP. The gro",

It's certainly been a busy week, and I'm glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone on the front lines of the pandemic all around the world. I also want to personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard to make sure our products and services are available for everyone right now. People looking for important health information, hard-hit businesses working to inform customers about opening hours or delivery options or teachers connecting to their students. The macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a reported basis and is flat year-over-year on a fixed FX basis. Like other companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization as users return to commercial activity online. This is true across most of our advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate remains fragile. \nOne thing I'd like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow new businesses.

Welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2016 earnings conference call. \n(Operator Instructions) \nAs a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Henninger,  Intel Corporation - VP of Finance & Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. \nBy now you should have received a copy of our earnings release, CFO commentary, and the announcement of our restructuring program. If you have not received all three documents, they are available on our investor website INTC.com. \nI'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the Q&A. \nBefore we begin let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. \nAnd a brief reminder that this quarter we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures following the acquisition of Altera, now our Programmable Solutions Group. Today we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on INTC.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. \nWith that out of the way, let me turn it over to Brian. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. \nOur results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased year-over-year driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group formerly known as Altera. Strength in our Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses partially offset weaker than expected PC revenues in our Client business. \nI'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we're announcing today. CCG revenue grew 2% year-over-year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory. Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and a 14th workweek. \nThe Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise. The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22% year-over-year, due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals. In the Memory business, strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines, leading to revenue that was 6% lower year-over-year, and in our Security business, revenue grew 12% as this team continues to tighten its focus and execut",

By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents they're available on our investor website, INTC.com.\nI'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer.

GAAP financial reconciliations are available in our earnings material, which was posted on our website, INTC.com, in advance of this call. The forecast that Stacy speaks to today will be on a non-GAAP basis.

Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with expectations, and marked a strong finish to the year. Taken as a whole, 2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy, which is designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and connected world. That strategy is also resulting in the evolution of our business model, to focus on three key areas of growth: The data center, the Internet of Things, and memory. Our results reflect that evolution. Revenue for the year was nearly flat, despite a significant decline in PC demand.\n2015 was also a year of revenue records and important milestones, and I'd like to take a minute to review some of them with you. Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8%, we were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second and third and fourth quarters. As of November, 14-nanometer products made up more than 50% of the client computing volume. And for the year, high end Core i7 micro processors and our K SKUs for gaming both set all-time volume records, leading to a rich product mix.\nIn our security business, we've refocused the organization on end point technology, where we enjoy a solid leadership position, and we've driven material efficiencies, as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel. The results of these changes have been dramatic. On a constant currency basis, security revenue rose 6% for the year, while the organization's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44% improvement in operating income. The IoT group grew revenue 7% in 20",

Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook. And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter. \nI'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications. I will start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the two-in-one and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360. \nNext the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year over year. Cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year. \nIn the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment, from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. \nWe continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice",

Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines, and serves as evidence of our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third-quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses.\nI'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I'll start with the client computing group, which had a stellar quarter. This team's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product costs, and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins.\nThe client computing group's revenue grew 5% over last year, but just as importantly, DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation. In the data center group, revenue grew 10% year over year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast.\nThe cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the [com] service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase.\nIn addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%.

Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue.\nAt our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries.

I'd like to cover three things with you today before handing off to Bob: a brief review of our results for the year, an update on the transformation of the Company, and a look ahead at 2017 and Intel's future. \nFirst, the review of our results. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year in which we increased revenue 7% and net income 9%. The Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things, and Intel Security all grew in 2016, with DCG and IoTG setting full-year revenue and volume records. \nThe acquisition of Altera added 3 percentage points to our overall growth rate. In the Data Center, cloud service provider revenue grew 24%, while enterprise revenue was down 3% for the full year. Additionally, we are very excited that Com Service Provider revenue grew 19%. And across all of our customer categories, adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21%, with strength in ethernet controllers, Omni-Path fabric controllers and switches, and network ASICs. \nIoT revenue was up 15% for the full year, driven by strength in the video, retail, and industrial segment. In Q4, we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake product, and we won key designs in automotive and video. \nOur Memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue, while full-year revenue was down 1%. This was an investment year for the memory business, but NSG operating margins",

Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities. And after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year-over-year. \nTechnology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and a strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year. \nAs we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. \nI'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The data center business grew 9% in Q2 and remained on track to hi",

The third quarter exceeded our expectations with revenue of $16.1 billion, which was $400 million better than our outlook. Operating income of $5.6 billion was more than $700 million better than our outlook. Our data-centric businesses grew 15% year-over-year, reaching 45% of our revenue, proving that Intel is becoming a data-centric company. \nThe fiscal discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster than we had forecasted, while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on innovation in our key growth segments. \nRevenue grew 2%, or 6% after adjusting for the McAfee transaction. Operating income grew 8%, and earnings per share grew 26%, both reaching all-time records. Added all together, and this was a remarkable quarter in what is shaping up to be a remarkable year. \nOur strategy is to be the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. Our data-centric businesses are the company's growth engine. Individually, these businesses provide great value to our customers. Collectively, they're solving our customers' problems in a way that no individual business or product could. \nWe've built a collection of capabilities that is unmatched. At the same time, our PC business remains central to our success. It's a source of great profit, cash flow, scale and intellectual prope",

Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks, Mark. Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continue to execute well, producing growth within a declining PC market. And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with our data-centric businesses, booting McAfee up 25% over the first quarter of last year. \nThe strength of Intel's business underscores my confidence in our strategy. What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business and it reinforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, FPGAs and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them as our first quarter results demonstrate. \nData Center Group revenue was up 24% year-over-year. We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer preference for high perfo",

I'll review our results with you in just a moment, but before I do that, I'd like to share a few words about security. \nWe've been working around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. While we've made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do. We've committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised (sic) [apprised] of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers' infrastructure on these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats",

Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. The second quarter was significantly stronger than we forecasted in April, and our results demonstrated our customers' preference for the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow, diversify and become increasingly complex. That need for performance manifested in strong mix in ASPs across the business. Our Q2 results are proof points for the megatrends that underpin our strategy. The world's insatiable appetite for data is driving demand for solutions to process, store and move it faster and better. Customers want to work with partners who can deliver performance and platforms to address their most important technology challenges.\nOur data-centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April expectations. Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest-performing products leading to strong mix in ASPs. While our cloud customers absorb capacity they put in place over the last year, we continue to expect cloud demand to improve in the second half. Enterprise and government spend",

Q3 2019 was the best quarter in our company's history. We generated $19.2 billion in revenue and $1.42 in non-GAAP EPS, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion and $0.18, respectively. We achieved record revenue both overall and in our data-centric businesses while making continued progress on our strategic priorities. Simply put, our ambitions have never been greater. We are growing share in a large and expanding $300 billion market opportunity fueled by the exponential growth of data, which is reshaping computing.\n\nI want to start with a recap of our May Analyst Day and our 3 priorities: Accelerating growth, improving execution and deploying capital for attractive returns. First, growth. It starts with a core belief. We are at a key inflection point with the exponential growth of data creating massive demand for semiconductors. Cloud workloads are diversifying. Networks are transforming",

We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on the top line and $0.15 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and now represent approximately 51% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric business grew 14%.\nWe'll talk about business trends later, but first, I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge.

Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%.\nI continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge.

I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChris Suh,  Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call, with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer, and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.\nOn our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call, and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals, and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items, to aid investors in further understanding the Company's third quarter performance, in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change to our external reporting segments, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently, cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense, and operating income growth at the company-wide level.\nPlease note that in the third quarter of FY16, we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB, that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation. One of the more significant changes require that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense, rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1, 2015, and hence impacts our previously reported quarterly results for FY16. You can find additional information in the financial summary slide deck, and in our 10-Q filing.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call, until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live, and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call, and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 21, 2017.\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or oth",

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. \nOn the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer and John Seethoff Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, Microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \nUnless otherwise specified we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company's fourth-quarter performance in addition to the impact of these items and events had on financial results. \nAdditionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which include research and development, sales and marketing, and general administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges.

We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. \nAt the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we're not able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. \nWe do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the Company-wide level. We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. \nToday's call is being Webcast live and recorded.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call.\nAs a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting our results under the new revenue standard, ASC 606. As we detailed during a conference call we hosted on August 3, the adoption of this standard had several impacts but most materially, the revenue recognition of Windows 10 OEM licenses and the license component of on-premises annuity contracts.\nAs we discuss our Q1 results and share our outlook on the call, please keep in mind the following: first, the new standard allows us to simplify the communication of our results by eliminating the non-GAAP revenue reporting; second, there is no change in customer billings, cash flows or revenue recognition for our cloud services, hardware, Enterprise Services and advertising businesses; and lastly, the quarterly seasonality of our revenue within a given year does change, and we may experience higher quarterly volatility as well.\nThe prior periods we'll reference on this call and in the earnings materials on our IR website have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. During our August 3 call, we also translated our outlook for Q1 into the new standard, and all references to expectations on this call refer to that translated guidance. You can find additional information on this accounting change located on the IR website.\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.\nToday's call is being webcast live and recorded.

We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\n  \nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
